GTS family, the market for gold goes up for two reasons, two reasons only. Uncertainty and war. When there is risk in the world, when there is danger, gold gets bought. When there is economic uncertainty, gold goes up. So what were the fundamental reasons that I have been talking about since the start of January? Well, let me remind you, with Trump coming into office, talking about tariffs and other things, there's a bit of economic uncertainty in gold. I believe institutions are buying up ahead of that. But also, what is the second biggest thing that affects our economy? Well, it's going to be interest rates, right? Interest rates are a big effect on the economy. They were so low up until COVID and after COVID, they've been very high and that affects things. And so when interest rates are high, dollar goes up and gold goes down. We have got the first non-farm payrolls today, which is one of the biggest things that the Federal Reserve uses for interest rates.
