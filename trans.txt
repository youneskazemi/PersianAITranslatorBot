and i just thought final message that i would say to you guys is you know i uh i'm not won't be entering the last signal why because a golden rule for me and this is again experiences i don't hold something that i've not entered and that i can't manage because it never entered even though it's so close um i won't be holding my entries and i will come back fresh on monday with new zones new setups new tp5s and then you know that is just the way i operate so with that being said have a good weekend i'll see you soon
